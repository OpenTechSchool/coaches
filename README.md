# coaches

This is a repo for people interested in **coaching at OpenTechSchool events**. 

Here we mostly announce new coaching oppurtunity or request of more coaches joining specific event.<br/>
For longer discussion about how to organize the event, we will likley move to [our discourse forum](discourse.opentechschool.org) to avoid spam.

 ## Coach Guidelines
 Be a coach with OTS can be different from other coaching experience you had. Have some rules we take very seriously.
 Before each event we do review the coaching guideline all together but feel free to read them at your own peace.
 Here's the coaches guidelines: http://opentechschool.github.io/slides/presentations/coaching/14
 
 Any feedbacks or suggestions for the coaching guidelines? Feel free to open an issue and discuss together!
